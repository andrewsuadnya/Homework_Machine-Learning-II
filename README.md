# Predicting Advertising Costs

## Introduction
This project aims to predict the advertising cost required to achieve a certain level of sales using simple linear regression.

## Dataset
The dataset contains two columns:
- Sales (in million $)
- Advertising (in million $)

## Methodology
A simple linear regression model was built using the Sales data to predict Advertising costs. The model's performance was evaluated using RMSE and R² score.

## Results
Predicted Advertising Costs:
- For 50 sales: $77.83 million
- For 100 sales: $173.58 million
- For 150 sales: $269.32 million

Model Evaluation:
- RMSE: [your RMSE value]
- R² Score: [your R² value]

## Conclusion
The model provides a reasonable prediction of advertising costs based on sales. Further improvements could be made by incorporating additional features or using more complex models.
